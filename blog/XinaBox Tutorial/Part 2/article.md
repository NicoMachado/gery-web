# Playing with XinaBox Part 2

In [part one](https://medium.com/@gerybbg/playing-with-xinabox-part-1-cfb742b676e7) of this tutorial series we created a temperature sensor. Although this little thing that we built is pretty cool, we have pretty much built a fancy thermometer. What's cooler than a fancy thermometer? A fancy thermometer that is connected to the internet. So, let's send our data to the cloud.

### What you willÂ need
- The XinaBox [device](https://medium.com/@gerybbg/playing-with-xinabox-part-1-cfb742b676e7) we built in part 1
- A [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (_Optional if you would like to run the app that reads the data from GCP IoT Core_)

### Connecting to WiFi
The first thing we need to do is connect our core programming chip to the internet. To do that we need to add some changes to our code.

- First we will include the WiFi library like this `#include <WiFi.h>`
- Next we need to define the SSID and Password of the network we will be connecting to:
  ```c
  #define WIFI_SSID "<Your SSID>"
  #define WIFI_PASSWORD "<Your password>"
  ```
- And now we can connect to the WiFi with this code:
  ```c
  void initWifi() {
    digitalWrite(RED_PIN, HIGH);
    OD01.println("Connecting to:");
    OD01.println(WIFI_SSID);

    WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD);
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)
    {
      OD01.println("Retry in 5 secs");
      WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD);
      delay(5000);
    }

    digitalWrite(RED_PIN, LOW);
    OD01.println("Connected to WiFi");
  }
  ```

This method needs to be called from inside the setup method. What it does is it attempts to connect to the internet and if it does not succeed for any reason (for example the chip is too far away from the router) it tries again after 5 seconds.

In order to be able to upload data to the cloud our core chip needs to have the correct timestamp. The CW02 (and it's ESP32 equivalent) can not keep time, however, when they are connected to a WiFi network a time can be set on them. To do this we need to add the following method and call it right after `initWifi()` in the `setup()` method.

```c
void syncTime() {
  configTime(0, 0, "pool.ntp.org", "time.nist.gov");
  while (time(nullptr) < 1510644967) {
    delay(10);
  }
}
```

Upload this code to your device to make sure you can connect to the internet.

### Sending data to the cloud
Now we can connect to the cloud and send data there. In this case we will be using Google Cloud Platform IoT Core.

There are two ways to setup your devices in GCP IoT Core, one is by using the [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) which allows you to do everything via command line. The other is by doing it in the console, or as I like to call it the "clicky" way. In this tutorial I will tell you how to do it the "clicky" way.

- Open up [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and log in
- Create a new project
- From the side menu click on *IoT Core*, this will prompt you to enable IoT Core API
- Once enabled it will prompt you to create a device registry. When creating a device registry you will also need to create to PubSub topics, one for telemetry data and one for state data. Although you can use the same topic for both of these, it is a good idea to keep them separate.
- After this is all done you are ready to add devices to your registry. In order to create a device you will need a public/private key pair to secure the communication between your device and the cloud. For this library to work we will be using an Elliptic Curve (EC) public/private key pair. To generate these run the following two commands in your terminal:
```
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out my_private_key.pem
openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -pubout -out my_public_key.pem
```
- Now you can create the device, remember to name your device something meaningful as this can not change once it has been created. You will also have to choose *ES256* as your algorithm and copy the entire public key including the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` parts.

Before we can get back to the code, we will need to install a few libraries. Go to Sketch-Include Library-Manage Libraries... and search for and install the following:

- [Google Cloud IoT Core JWT](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-iot-arduino): used for authenticating our devices using JSON web tokens.
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient): This is used by the library above to communicate with IoT Core.
- [Buffered Streams](https://github.com/paulo-raca/ArduinoBufferedStreams): This is also used by the Google Cloud library for communicating with IoT Core.
- [MQTT](https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt): This is used to create a client and send data using the MQTT protocol to IoT Core.

And now, we can finally write some more code:

- Starting with some configuration, define the following replacing all of the relevant properties:
  ```c
  const char *project_id = "my-project";
  const char *location = "europe-west1";
  const char *registry_id = "my-registry";
  const char *device_id = "my-device";

  const char *private_key_str =
      "00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:"
      "00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:"
      "00:00";

  const char *root_cert =
      "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"

  ```
- To get the private key string run the command `openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -noout -text` in the folder where you created your keys and copy the private key part. It should be the exact same length as the one in the example above.
- To get the root cert run the command `openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mqtt.googleapis.com:8883` and copy the certificate.
- Next we need to include some libraries and define some variables:
  ```c
  #include <MQTT.h>
  #include <CloudIoTCore.h>
  #include <WiFi.h>
  #include <WiFiClientSecure.h>

  WiFiClientSecure *netClient;
  MQTTClient *mqttClient;
  CloudIoTCoreDevice *device;
  unsigned long iss = 0;
  String jwt;
  ```
- In the setup method, after we connect to the internet and synchronize the time we need to start the MQTT client:
  ```c
  void initCloudIoT() {
    device = new CloudIoTCoreDevice(
        project_id, location, registry_id, device_id, 
        private_key_str);

    netClient = new WiFiClientSecure();
    mqttClient = new MQTTClient(512);
    mqttClient->begin("mqtt.googleapis.com", 8883, *netClient);
    OD01.println("MQTT started");
  }
  ```
- Then inside our loop method we need to do two things. Check if we are connected to the MQTT client and if not connect to it. And after that we can publish the temperature data to MQTT. We do this by replacing our MQTT method with the following:
  ```c
  void loop() {
    if (!mqttClient->connected()) {
      digitalWrite(RED_PIN, HIGH);
      if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        initWifi();
      }
      mqttConnect();
      digitalWrite(RED_PIN, LOW);
    }

    digitalWrite(GREEN_PIN, HIGH);
    bme680.setForcedMode();
    double temperature = bme680.readTemperature();
    String message = "Temperature " + String(temperature) + "C";
    OD01.println(message);
    mqttClient->publish(device->getEventsTopic(), message);
    digitalWrite(GREEN_PIN, LOW);
    delay(10000);
  }
  ```
- The code above calls a method called `mqttConnect()` which we have not implemented yet. This method connects to MQTT by first creating a JWT and then subscribing to the state (configurations) and telemetry (commands) topics that we created in our IoT Core registry.
  ```c
  void mqttConnect() {
    while (!mqttClient->connect(device->getClientId().c_str(), "unused", getJwt().c_str(), false)) {
      delay(1000);
    }
    OD01.println("Connected to MQTT");
    mqttClient->subscribe(device->getConfigTopic());
    mqttClient->subscribe(device->getCommandsTopic());
  }

  String getJwt() {
    //This checks if the JWT has expired and creates a new one if it has
    if (iss == 0 || time(nullptr) - iss > 3600) {
      iss = time(nullptr);
      jwt = device->createJWT(iss);
    }
    return jwt;
  }
  ```

At this point you can upload the code again and see if the data is being sent correctly.

//TODO: read data node (optional)
